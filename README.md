**To run the app:**

1. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies

2. Run ```npm start``` to run the server

3. Navigate to ```localhost:3000` (if it doesn't open automatically)

4. Enjoy learning about the planets of Star Wars! :) 

Areas I would like to improve on:
- Have more tests to test the functionality of the search, pagination and filtering
- Make the table responsive so that it works on different screen sizes

Thanks for looking :)
